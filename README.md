Register Number: 25013585


AIM:
Write a C program to read a float value from the user and to display the same value.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Declare a float variable to store the input value.
Read the float value from the user using the scanf function.
Print the float value using the printf function with two decimal places (%.2f).
End the program.


PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float num;
    scanf("%f",&num);
    printf("%.2f",num);
    return 0;
}
```
OUTPUT:

RESULT:

  Thus the program to find the float value from the user and to display the same value runs successfully.






Program-1-b
C-Module 1
EX_NO-01)b)-Conditional Statements

AIM:

Write a C program to read A values and check whether the value is greater than and equal to 100.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.

Declare an integer variable to store the input value.

Read the integer value from the user using the scanf function.

Check if the value is greater than or equal to 100.

a. If true, print "The Value is greater than or equal to 100".

b. If false, do nothing (or skip printing).

End the program.
```

PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int num;
    scanf("%d",&num);
    if(num>=100){printf(
        "The Value is greater than or equal to 100");}
    
 return 0;   
}
```
